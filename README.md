This web application was deployed using AWS Amplify. I have added authentication to the app allowing users to sign up, sign in, and manage their account. The app also has a scalable GraphQL API configured with an Amazon DynamoDB database, allowing users to create and delete notes. Finally, I have added file storage using Amazon S3 so that users can upload images and view them in their app.
